NetIDE aims to deliver a single development environment to support the whole development lifecycle of Software-Defined Network programs in a vendor- and controller-independent fashion. Nowadays, while most of the programmable network apparatus vendors support OpenFlow or other south-bound protocols, a number of fragmented control plane solutions exist for Software-Defined Networks. Thus, network applications developers need to re-code their solutions every time they encounter a network infrastructure based on a different controller. NetIDE is approaching the problem through an architectural solution that will allow different high-level representations to be used to program the network and different controllers to execute the network programs. Our core work is the definition of a common language able to cover different network programming styles: the NetIDE IRF (Intermediate Representation Format). The IRF allows us to explore new techniques to perform cross-controller debugging and profiling of network programs; heterogeneous network programming; network programming with simulators in the loop.
